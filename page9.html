      <h2><center>Xenofeminism Manifesto Response</h2>
      <p>After reading the Xenofeminist Manifesto, I must admit that I feel slightly overwhelmed by the vocabulary and sheer amount of information in the document. Yet beyond the complicated language presented, a very powerful argument was presented. The core ideas of the manifesto deeply resonate. One idea in the manifesto which I find particularly interesting is its goal to
“strategically deploy existing technologies to re-engineer the world” (0x02), with regards to gender. Rather than eliminating technologies which have, in many ways, worked against the feminist or other gender movements, Xenofeminism aims to re-engineer the way we use these outlets. Another central idea which I found very interesting was the idea of gender-abolitionism. As I understood it, Xenofeminism does not aim to eliminate the idea of gender in our world. Rather, Xenofeminism aims to eradicate the toxic hierarchies of power which are associated with gender. In fact, Xenofeminism advocates for more genders, or at least whichever the people feel are necessary. The idea of gender is not destructive, but rather the ideas which have become associated with it. I found Xenofeminism’s approach to this idea very interesting, as it feels more rational, or less “militant,” than other movements. In many ways, this approach allows Xenofeminism to be more appealing to a greater audience. Yet while it might be able to appeal to more people, I found accessibility to be an issue with this manifesto. With such a diverse and complex vocabulary which often relies on context, the manifesto presents itself as a difficult document to digest if one is not fluent in the language. The manifesto uses a language which is very much specific to the movement and others like it. This presents a problem of accessibility. How is someone new to the movement able to understand this document without knowledge of the necessary vocabulary. I think it is important for a movement like this to consider its audience, and attempt to make its ideas and message accessible to a wide range of people, not just academics or those well-versed in the movement. Overall, the manifesto presents strong ideas but is held back by complex and nuanced vocabulary.
