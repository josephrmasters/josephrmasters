      <h2><center>Postscript on the Societies of Control: Why is surfing brought up?</h2>
      <p>Surfing is an interesting case study of the individual. In this text, surfing is brought up in relation to older sports, presumably football or soccer. Surfing is a great example of individuality. It is a space where the individual, and only the individual, can display his/her talents. Compared to the older sports, which rely on a team’s cooperation, surfing gives total power and control to the individual. As an idea, there is no goal or motivation to “win” surfing, in fact, there is no winning. You either ride the wave, or you don’t. Perhaps in a competition there is a victor, but each individual is only focused on outperforming themselves. As an evolution from older sports, surfing presents a sport with greater focus on individuality. Less so than the likes of golf or other individual sports, surfing also presents a new kind of sport which does not rely on winning or losing, much less the normal conventions of other sports. Instead, surfing celebrates individuality as its own sort of competition. The kind where personal success and fulfillment surpasses an victory or triumph of the traditional sense. It is a new form of individuality.</p>
