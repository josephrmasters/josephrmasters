      <h2><center>How is Rauschenberg's work different from other collage work that came before it?
</h2>
      <p>Rauschenbergâ€™s collage work has a certain quality to it which the collage work of other artists who came before him were simply not able to attain. His works is already unique, as it was developed at the exact time in which single-image painting was the dominant mode of art in the country. Yet although collage work was something that had been done before, Rauschenberg achieved a sort of reinvention with regards to the style. Many of the artists who came before Rauschenberg practiced collage art as a sort of translation. That is to say, they simply worked to convert a three dimensional image or object into something two dimensional, which could be placed on a canvas. Rauschenberg approached collage work with a different mindset. Rather than converting an image to be usable for a canvas or work of art, he simply transferred the image into his canvas or work. Because of this, he allowed the object to retain its original meaning or idea, just in the form of living in his artwork. This practice made Rauschenberg a revolutionary with regards to collage work, and art culture in general.</p>
