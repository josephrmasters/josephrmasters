      <h2><center>Philosophize This! Podcast, Michel Foucault, Pt. 2: How does the Panopticon play into our contemporary lives?</h2>
      <p>The Panopticon is an interesting practice of surveillance in our society. As a structure (specifically prison), it promotes self-regulation through constant surveillance. Though it was designed in the 18th century, the idea behind this structure still bears relevance in our society today. The structure practices a kind of never-ending surveillance. This structure creates a power dynamic between the prisoners and the guards. The prisoners, in theory, are always being watched, thus they never try to escape or act incorrectly. Even further, when the prisoners are unable to see the guards, the power that the guards have is only amplified, as Foucault claims that power becomes even more powerful when invisible. But beyond the theory and ideas behind the panopticon, the core idea that it supports is extremely relevant to our world today. The structure essentially supports the idea that better surveillance supports better behavior. We see this throughout the world, specifically in places like China. In the last several years, China has heavily updated security throughout the country, installing over 400 million new security cameras. In addition to this updated security, the country has supported a social credit system, which incentivizes good behavior. The core idea behind China’s new system is that more surveillance creates better behavior. In China’s new system, we see it directly borrowing from that presented with the Panopticon.</p>
