      <h2><center>How is Owen's work related to the internet?</h2>
      <p>Much like the internet, the work of Laura Owens in a controlled chaos. Though it might not seem like it at first, there is a theme and pattern in Owens’ work. Upon first glance one would see the gallery filled with paintings bearing little resemblance to one another. Some extremely abstract with other barely painted at all. Yet among all these paintings there is some reason. I can tell just from a single visit that Owens loves color. In all of her paintings, even in one dominated by black and white, color prevails. Each painting brings a new palette and new shades. No two colors are alike in this gallery. Owens clearly sees the world through a vivid and saturated lens. Much like the internet this gallery is a jumble of wildly different things; all somehow working together to create coherent, living organism. Owens work is not for those who lack patience. Only in walking through several times does any sort of meaning emerge. Much like the internet, Owens’ work takes some getting used to. Even more so, it takes some time to even like. But given a chance, Owens’ chaotic expression becomes quite clear. Meaning is behind each canvas. She utilizes so many different textures, colors, and techniques to create a gallery with leaves no door closed. Her work is wildly beautiful, with emphasis on wild. It is outlandish, even weird, but nonetheless leaves the viewer thinking. Owens’ plays by no one else’s rules but her own, and that is clearly seen. It’s as if she adopted the persona of the internet when making this work. With such a collection of texture, culture, and aesthetic, Owens has created an artistic potluck. There are many parallels between Owens, her work, and the internet. But there is one specific takeaway from all of this. Just like the internet, Owens is not afraid to display her expression.</p>
