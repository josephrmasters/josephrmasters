      <h2><center>Pierre Huyghe: How is time relevant in his work?</h2>
      <p>The work of Pierre Huyghe explores the concept of time in very interesting ways. Take for instance his work Exomind (Deep Water), 2017. This work features a concrete statue standing alone in an open garden. Yet growing on the head of this statue is live bee hive. I find this work by Huyghe to be incredibly beautiful. It presents an interesting juxtaposition regarding time. On one hand, the concrete statue represents a permanent aspect of time, or at least something which moves through time with little change. On the other hand, the beehive is something which grows quite quickly, and is constantly changing. Huyghe has created a work which combines to very different experiences of time. I find this exploration of time to be almost poetic. Within the work, each representation can exist without the other, yet in this work the two work together. Huygheâ€™s explores time in way which I have not seen in the work of other artists, and it presents ideas regarding how different passages of time interact with one another. I find his work truly thought-provoking. </p>
