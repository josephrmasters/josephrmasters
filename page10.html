      <h2><center>In Defense of the Poor Image: What is the relationship of speed or velocity and digital images?</h2>
      <p>Hito Steyerl explores the idea of “the poor image,” in her essay In Defense of the Poor Image. One aspect of the poor image that she discusses is how it relates to speed or velocity. In literal terms, these poor images are compressed heavily and are thus able to move quickly throughout the internet. Yet beyond that, they move quickly in other ways. When an image becomes “poor,” whether it be low resolution or otherwise, its ability to travel fast also brings a greater accessibility. As Steyerl expands upon, the poor image is one that is not what it used to be in its pure, original form. The poor image is one which is able to circulate throughout the internet and be passed through many hands. Whereas perfect cinema and the capitalism of cinema keep the highest resolution on for the elite films, the poor image is one which anyone has access to. Anyone can view it online, and beyond that, can download it and alter it however they want. Accessibility is perhaps the most notable feature of the poor image. Yet what interests me most is how once an image becomes reproduced, and “poor,” it is able to move incredibly fast. Yet Steyerl expands upon this idea, stating it is not necessarily a bad thing that the image becomes “poorer” each time it is passed on. We must begin to think of the “poor” image in a different way; not as “poor,” but rather of its own originality. In each state, it doesn’t lose quality, but simply changes forms. Thinking of it in this way, velocity and speed relating to the poor image should not be seen as ways in which the image continually loses quality. Rather, we should see it as how quickly an image is able to become more original.</p>
