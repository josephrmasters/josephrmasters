      <h2><center>How is Ayn Rand's philosophy relevant today?</h2>
      <p>Ayn Rand’s philosophy, known as Objectivism, is based on rather unique, radical ideas. Rand specifically challenges the idea of altruism, which states that men and women live for the sole purpose of helping others. This idea, which furthers the notion that humanity is truly good, is acknowledged and dismissed as unreasonable by Rand. Rand supports an ideology which states nearly the opposite of altruism. Objectivism is based on selfishness. Yet while this may seem to paint humanity in an evil light, Rand’s philosophy is not as ruthless at it may seem. Her advocating for selfishness is based upon the goal of the genuine, best self-interest of the individual. Rather than sacrificing for the benefit of others, Rand suggests that the individual should focus on themselves and their own well-being. The ideas presented by Objectivism are still very relevant today, but on the internet and in real life. As a capitalist society, more and more emphasis has been put on the success of the individual as measured to others. In this competitive landscape, selfishness, or striving for one’s self-interest first is certainly the primary ideology. On social media, the individual is the central focus. Individuals can call attention to themselves, and use their platforms for personal gain. That isn’t to say that there aren’t altruistic individuals still in the world. On the contrary, I would even argue that most people are altruistic deep down. Yet the internet and social media has created a toxic, artificial environment that breeds selfishness and self-interest. And in the eyes of Rand, these are not bad things. It is clear that her philosophy still plays a role in our society today. Again, Objectivism is not necessarily a bad thing. Looked at in a positive light, Objectivism fosters a society in which self-care is paramount; something America could benefit from. Yet where is the line drawn between searching for your best happiness and favoring selfishness as opposed to altruism. As Rand would say, no man or woman is responsible for the well-being of others. Yet my own beliefs do not allow me to support this ideology. Because of this, I see the most merit in Rand’s philosophy in viewing it through a positive lens. Seeing it in that way, it is clear that Rand’s philosophy takes many forms in today’s society. Regardless of how one might view Rand’s Objectivism, it is undeniable that it has manifested itself both on the internet and in real life. It is simply a matter of how the individual chooses to view the philosophy that determines how it affects their life today.</p>
