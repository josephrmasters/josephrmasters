      <h2><center>       What is the relationship between diagrams and meaning?</h2>
      <p>I have often thought of diagrams as being purely scientific; something which connects anatomy. Yet after our in-class exercise drawing diagrams, I had a realization. Yes, diagrams are rooted in logic and reason. However, they have a greater relationship with meaning that goes beyond a simple line connecting things. I believe the purpose of a diagram is to explain something, either simple or complex, in the most basic way possible. In science, we see the human body deconstructed by diagrams to illustrate every different aspect with greatest clarity.It is in this that we see the connection between diagrams and meaning. The meaning they provide is far more than each individual part. Rather, diagrams provide a holistic meaning which illustrates how many separate parts work together to create. Though a diagram finds much of its meaning in clear definition, what remains is a powerful message on the interaction of separate entities to create a larger working system. It quite remarkable that a diagram can explain how and why life is. Furthermore, while the purpose of a diagram is to explain, it actually enables us to question. Without the clear distinctions as to why things are the way they are, we would not be able to question how or why they work. That is to say, without the explanation provided by diagrams, we could never be skeptical or challenge an idea. Diagrams provide us the foundation to do so. And even further beyond that, diagrams gift us the opportunity to even question their own meaning. Through their clarity, or lack thereof, we are able to further question why a specific meaning is tied to one diagram, or what it represents. Diagrams enable us to question the world around us, and find meaning in everything.</p>
