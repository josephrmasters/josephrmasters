      <h2><center>Cybernetics: Is cybernetcs a useful tool for describing reality?</h2>
      <p>In All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace, we get an introduction to the fundamentals of cybernetics. As its name suggests, it is rooted in the power of machines. More importantly, cybernetics is an exploration of the role that machines play in our human existence. Cybernetics is entirely based on the study of feedback loops; essentially examining the idea of actions and reactions, and viewing everything as a system. While this makes sense in exploring how machines learn and make decisions, is becomes more complicated when applying the same ideas to humanity. Norbert Wiener was one of the first to explore this idea, and his findings present an entirely different way of viewing the world. He believes that humans act as nodes in a greater system. Rather than viewing a single human as an individual, they should be viewed in the context of a greater system, effectively making them one part of this greater, complex system. His idea of cybernetics would also suggest that the concept of feedback in a system applies to everything from the human brain, cities, and even entire societies. Everything, Weiner believes, can be seen as a system regulated by feedback. Yet knowing this theory about a new way to view society, and nearly everything in our world, it is important to note that cybernetics does not differentiate between humans and machines as it is, quite simply, how a computer views the world. Because of this it is difficult to say whether cybernetics is a useful tool for describing reality. In one way, it is an effective way of simplifying our reality. There are so many factors, such as human emotion, which complicate human reality. Cybernetics provides a means through which this complexity can be removed. Yet, human emotion provides so many things and influences our societies in ways that a computer could not understand, and leads me to believe that we would be foolish to try to simplify something as complex as our reality through the use of cybernetics. Though is offers an interesting, new perspective and is a useful tool, it does not offer an accurate description of our reality. </p>
